Lantz Drivers
============================
Inside the drivers folder, there are a bunch of folders, each with the name of
the manufacturer of the instrument's driver. Contained in each folder are the
drivers for each instrument, and the init file. In this page, we go through the
Keysight 33622A Arbitrary Waveform Generator.

__init__.py
^^^^^^^^^^^
The init file should look something like this::

    from .Keysight_33622A import Keysight_33622A
    from .seqbuild import SeqBuild
    from .arbseq_class import Arbseq_Class

    __all__ = ['Keysight_33622A', 'SeqBuild', 'Arbseq_Class']

There may be more files than are imported here. However, all files that you will
use now or in the future should be included in the init file. The first driver,
Keysight_33622A, is the main driver. SeqBuild and Arbseq_Class are merely classes
that help the driver build arbitrary waveforms. For all intents and purposes, the
contents of the latter two classes could have been included in the main driver.
That's all that needs to be done for init. Most driver folders will only have
main driver files, many even only having one file if we only have one machine
from that particular company.

Keysight_33622A.py
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The header of the main driver file looks like this::

    from lantz import Feat, DictFeat, Action
    from lantz.messagebased import MessageBasedDriver
    from lantz.drivers.keysight.arbseq_class import Arbseq_Class
    from time import sleep

    class Keysight_33622A(MessageBasedDriver):
