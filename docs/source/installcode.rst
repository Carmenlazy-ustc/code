Installation
============
This page will go through installing the code in a new pc. Currently, code only works on a Windows PC.
Before starting, check the following:
1. Check if you have conda installed by opening command line (cmd) and typing::

    conda --v

If conda can't be found, then install from  <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_. and run the .exe, and follow the instructions.

.. note::
   Add miniconda to PATH during the installation (Should be a check box).
   If you don't, you may have to add conda to your PATH later.

2. Check if you have pip installed by opening command line (cmd) and typing::

	pip --version

If pip can't be found, make sure any verison of python is installed. Then go to <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_.
and follow "install with get-pip.py".

3. Get familiar with command line. For the installation, you need::

	cd
	dir (ls for unix systems)

cd will change your current working directory to the specified directory, and cd .. will move you one directory back.
dir will show you all directories and files in your current directory.
